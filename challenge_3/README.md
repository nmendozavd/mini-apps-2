# Challenge 3: Bowling
## Basic Requirements
Build a single-page app implementation of a 10-pin Bowling game using Express and React. You should:

* Use Express to serve up an index.html file and its associated assets
* Build your UI using ReactJS and bundle with Webpack
* Implement the individual gameplay logic in the client code

To satisfy the minimum requirements of this challenge, start with a user interface that allows for pin quantity selection only; i.e. the UI allows the player to select the number of pins hit on each bowl, not which pins were hit. Suggestion: create a telephone keypad-style UI that includes '10'. No CSS styling is necessary. Use the browser's default styling for all elements on your page.

Additionally, simplify gameplay by initially making this a one-person game. This allows you to focus on building and modeling the scorecard UI and scoring algorithm for a single player. As bowls happen, keep track of the score for each bowl, frame and the total score. Use React components to display the game progression and total score in the UI.

Write tests to ensure all the nuances of the scoring rules  are correctly implemented.

## Advanced Content

* Add some routes to your server to save the result of each game.
* Store your scores in MongoDB, so they are not lost when the server restarts (such as reloading by nodemon). You should use the mongoose DB adapter to interface with MongoDB.
* Add a scoreboard view that fetches the last 30 game results from the server.
* Add pagination to the scoreboard.
* Modify the UI such that it displays the actual pins selected and when the user selects a pin quantity for a bowl, a random set of pins is selected.
* Add the ability to switch between automatic (random) pin selection or manual pin selection on each round.
* Add CSS styling to make the UI presentation pleasant. Use an external style sheet.

## Nightmare Mode
* Turn this into a multiplayer game
